# libcec-imx6-arch
PKGBUILD file for building libcec 3 with changes https://github.com/xbmc-imx6/libcec (mainly made by [Wolfgar](https://github.com/wolfgar)).

This PKGBUILD depends on Platform, which can be build by the PKGBUILD provided [here](https://github.com/zpon/libplatform-arch).

# Why?
KODI now depends on libcec 3 which is not currently available.
