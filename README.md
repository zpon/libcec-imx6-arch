# libcec-imx6-arch
PKGBUILD file for building libcec 3 for imx6. The repository used is https://github.com/zpon/libcec-imx6, which contains changes from https://github.com/xbmc-imx6/libcec (mainly made by [Wolfgar](https://github.com/wolfgar)) merged with the [original libcec repository](https://github.com/xbmc-imx6/libcec).

This PKGBUILD depends on Platform, which can be build by the PKGBUILD provided [here](https://github.com/zpon/libplatform-arch).

# Why?
KODI now depends on libcec 3 which is not currently available in Arch ARM [libcec-imx](https://github.com/archlinuxarm/PKGBUILDs/blob/master/alarm/xbmc-imx/PKGBUILD) package.
